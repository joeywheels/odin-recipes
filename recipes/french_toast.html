        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you 
            just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!
        </p>
        <p>
            French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh 
            ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a 
            requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.
