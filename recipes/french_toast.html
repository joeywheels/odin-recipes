        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you 
            just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's what we have here!
        </p>
        <p>
            French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh 
            ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a 
            requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>6 thick slices bread</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Lightly butter a griddle and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides. Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden,
