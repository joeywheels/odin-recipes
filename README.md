Odin Recipes Site

The initial project for The Odin Project - Create a simple recipes website.
I will demonstrate a firm grasp of basic HTML exhibiting knowledge of:

- Creating links using the a element and href attribute
- Embed images into the page(s) using the img element with the src and alt
attributes
- Create both ordered and unordered lists
- Use source control being cognizant of commit messaging and frequency
